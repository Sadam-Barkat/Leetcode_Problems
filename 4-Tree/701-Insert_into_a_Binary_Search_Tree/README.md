# Second Minimum Node in a Special Binary Tree

## Problem Statement

Given a non-empty special binary tree consisting of nodes with non-negative values, where each node in this tree has either exactly two sub-nodes or no sub-nodes. If the node has two sub-nodes, then this node's value is the smaller value among its two sub-nodes. More formally, the property `root.val = min(root.left.val, root.right.val)` always holds.

Your task is to output the second minimum value in the set made of all the nodes' values in the whole tree.

If no such second minimum value exists, output `-1`.

## Approach

### 1. Tree Structure Analysis
- Each node in the tree can either have two children or no children. 
- If a node has two children, its value is the minimum of the values of its two children.

### 2. Define the Problem
- The task is to find the second smallest value in the tree.
- The smallest value is always the root value, which is the minimum of its children.
- To find the second smallest value, we must identify all unique values in the tree and sort them.

### 3. Considerations
- If all nodes have the same value, there's no second minimum.
- If the second minimum doesn't exist (i.e., there are no values larger than the minimum), we should return `-1`.

### 4. Solution Steps
1. Traverse the tree using DFS or BFS.
2. Collect all unique values from the tree in a set.
3. If the set contains more than one value, sort the values and return the second smallest.
4. If the set contains only one value, return `-1`.

## Example Walkthrough

### Example 1:

**Input:**
root = [2,2,5,null,null,5,7]

markdown
Copy code

- Root is `2`, with children `2` and `5`.
- `5` is the second smallest value in the tree.

**Output:**
5

### Example 2:

**Input:**
root = [2,2,2]

markdown
Copy code

- Root is `2`, and all its children are also `2`.
- No second smallest value exists.

**Output:**
-1

## Constraints
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 25]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 2^{31} - 1`
- `root.val == min(root.left.val, root.right.val)` for each internal node of the tree.

## Notes
- The problem is based on traversing the tree and identifying the unique values. Since the tree is small (up to 25 nodes), this approach is efficient.
- The solution depends on checking all nodes and storing their values to determine the second smallest.
