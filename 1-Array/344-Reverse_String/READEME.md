# Reverse String Function

This function reverses a string provided as an array of characters, modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

## Problem Statement
You are given an input string represented as an array of characters `s`. Your task is to reverse the string by modifying the input array directly.

## Examples

- **Example 1**:
  - **Input**: `s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]`
  - **Output**: `["o","l","l","e","h"]`

- **Example 2**:
  - **Input**: `s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]`
  - **Output**: `["h","a","n","n","a","H"]`

## Constraints
- The length of `s` must be between `1` and `10^5` (inclusive).
- Each character in `s` is a printable ASCII character.
